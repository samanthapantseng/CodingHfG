            <h3>About it</h3>
            <p> The million-copy bestselling series. Toshikazu Kawaguchi's moving <b>Before the Coffee Gets Cold</b>,
                translated
                from Japanese by Geoffrey Trousselot, explores the age-old question: what would you do if you could
                travel
                back in time? More importantly, who would you want to meet, maybe for one last time?</p>

            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p> In a narrow back alley in Tokyo lies a café called <i>Funiculi Funicula</i>. In the café, customers have
                the
                opportunity to travel back to a time of their choosing, as long as they follow a long list of rules.
                There is only one seat in the café that allows time travel; the seat is only available when the ghost
                that usually occupies it goes for a toilet break; once back in time, customers can't leave the seat; the
                only people in the past who can be met are people who have visited the café; whatever happens in the
                past, the present won't change; and, most importantly, the customer has to return to the present before
                their cup of coffee goes cold (around 1 hour). <br> <br>

                The novel follows the stories of the café staff, notably barista Kazu, and four different customers. The
                first, a businesswoman named Fumiko, tries to repair her relationship with her boyfriend after he left
                the country for a job in the United States. The second, a nurse named Kohtake, tries to find a letter
                her Alzheimer-stricken husband wrote. The third, a bar owner named Hirai, tries to talk to her sister
                whom she's been avoiding. The fourth, one of the café co-owners named Kei, tries to go to the future to
                talk to her unborn daughter.</p>
